      <p className="page-intro">
        CrewSync was born from the chaotic energy of large-scale events. We saw the logistical puzzles organizers faceâ€”messy spreadsheets, endless group chats, and the constant challenge of keeping everyone informed. Our mission is to replace that chaos with clarity and connection.
