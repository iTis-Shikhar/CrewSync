      <h1>About CrewSync</h1>
      <p>
        CrewSync was born out of the chaotic energy of large-scale events. We saw firsthand the challenges organizers face: last-minute schedule changes, tracking volunteer attendance, and ensuring everyone knows their specific duties. It's a logistical puzzle that often relies on messy spreadsheets, endless group chats, and a lot of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to replace that chaos with clarity. CrewSync is a centralized dashboard designed for event organizers to effortlessly create shift schedules, assign duties, and communicate with their team. For volunteers, it's a personalized, real-time view of their tasks, ensuring they are always informed and empowered.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that a well-organized crew is the backbone of any successful event. Let's get in sync.
