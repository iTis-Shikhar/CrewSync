## üöÄ The Problem

Managing student volunteers during large-scale events is often chaotic. Organizers struggle with messy spreadsheets, last-minute communication, and tracking who is supposed to be where and when. This leads to confusion, missed shifts, and a stressful experience for both the organizers and the dedicated volunteers.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**CrewSync** is a real-time, role-based web application designed to replace that chaos with clarity and connection. It provides a powerful, centralized platform for event organizers to manage every aspect of their volunteer workforce, and a personalized, empowering dashboard for volunteers to stay informed and engaged.

* **Comprehensive Event Management:** Create multi-day events with start and end dates. View all events in a clean, card-based layout.
* **Advanced Volunteer Roster:** Instead of manually typing emails, admins can add volunteers from a searchable, multi-select directory of all registered users, making roster creation fast and error-free.
* **Detailed Shift Scheduling:** For each event, create specific shifts with unique dates, start times, and end times.
* **Real-Time Announcements:** Send instant announcements to all volunteers rostered for a specific event, ensuring everyone gets critical information immediately.

* **Upcoming vs. Past Shifts:** The dashboard is intelligently split into "Upcoming Shifts" for active duties and a "Past Shifts" section for completed work.
